## How to Install and run the server
  To create a server on your computer you will need to have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

  In your terminal, go to your project location and type `node server.js`. This will run the script to create the server locally to host the webpage for your browser . Type `localhost:3000` as the url and you are good to go.
